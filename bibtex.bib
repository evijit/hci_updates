	abstract = {Installing security-relevant software updates is one of the best
computer protection mechanisms. However, users do not always choose to install updates. Through interviewing nonexpert Windows users, we found that users frequently decide
not to install future updates, regardless of whether they are
important for security, after negative experiences with past
updates. This means that even non-security updates (such
as user interface changes) can impact the security of a computer. We discuss three themes impacting users’ willingness
to install updates: unexpected new features in an update, the
difficulty of assessing whether an update is “worth it”, and
confusion about why an update is necessary.},

	abstract = {Botnets have become a vital part of underground economy and botherders are actively looking for new recruits to join their bot army. A lapse by an end user or an administrator in terms of not updating their software enables the botherder to achieve this objective. In this paper we will investigate the phenomenon of a machine infection from the perspective of a user update behavior. We also present type of attacks that are launched by hackers to compromise machine and the vulnerabilities that lead to such attacks as a result of update behavior. We will also characterize the user update behavior on the test network of study. Finally we will compare the update behavior of machines that were infected with the ones that were not infected. The objective of this investigation is to see if update behavior could be used as an effective security metric, our trends show that there is a very clear correlation between the machines that were infected and the machines that were not updated.},

	abstract = {Today’s software update systems have little or no defense
against key compromise. As a result, key compromises have
put millions of software update clients at risk. Here we identify three classes of information whose authenticity and integrity are critical for secure software updates. Analyzing
existing software update systems with our framework, we
find their ability to communicate this information securely
in the event of a key compromise to be weak or nonexistent.
We also find that the security problems in current software
update systems are compounded by inadequate trust revocation mechanisms. We identify core security principles that
allow software update systems to survive key compromise.
Using these ideas, we design and implement TUF, a software
update framework that increases resilience to key compromise.},

	abstract = {Fast and effective distribution of software updates (a.k.a. patches)
to millions of Internet users has evolved into a critical task over the
last years. In this paper, we characterize “Windows Update”, one
of the largest update services in the world, with the aim to draw
general guidelines on how to best design and architect a fast and
effective planet-scale patch dissemination system. To this end, we
analyze an extensive set of data traces collected over the period
of a year, consisting of billions of queries from over 300 million
computers. Based on empirical observations and analytical results,
we identify interesting properties of today’s update traffic and user
behavior.
Building on this analysis, we consider alternative patch delivery
strategies such as caching and peer-to-peer and evaluate their performance. We identify key factors that determine the effectiveness
of these schemes in reducing the server workload and the network
traffic, and in speeding-up the patch delivery. Most of our findings
are invariant properties induced by either user behavior or architectural characteristics of today’s Internet, and thus apply to the general problem of Internet-wide dissemination of software updates.},
